post-receive-multimail.py is a Python script that sends notification
emails for pushes to a git repository.  It is derived from
contrib/hooks/post-receive-mail, but has many differences:

* One email per commit [1].  For each reference change, the script
  first outputs one email summarizing the reference change (including
  one-line summaries of the new commits), then it outputs a separate
  email for each new commit that was introduced, including patches.
  The commit notification emails are threaded to the reference change
  email via "In-Reply-To".  This style (similar to the "git
  format-patch" style used on the git mailing list) makes it much
  easier to scan through the emails, jump to patches that need further
  attention, and write comments about specific emails.  Commits are
  handled in reverse topological order (i.e., parents shown before
  children).  For example,

  [repo] branch master updated
  + [repo] 01/08: doc: fix xref link from api docs to manual pages
  + [repo] 02/08: api-credentials.txt: show the big picture first
  + [repo] 03/08: api-credentials.txt: mention credential.helper explicitly
  + [repo] 04/08: api-credentials.txt: add "see also" section
  + [repo] 05/08: t3510 (cherry-pick-sequence): add missing '&&'
  + [repo] 06/08: Merge branch 'rr/maint-t3510-cascade-fix'
  + [repo] 07/08: Merge branch 'mm/api-credentials-doc'
  + [repo] 08/08: Git 1.7.11-rc2

* (Mostly) use template expansion to generate email contents.

* By default, use a short version of the repository name in the prefix
  for the emails' subject lines.

* Better algorithm for detecting new commits [2].
  post-receive-multimail.py analyzes all reference modifications to
  determine which commits were not present before the change.

* Add an "Environment" abstraction that describes the environment in
  which the script is running.  Users can override this class to
  customize the script to their own environment, for example by
  reading users' email addresses from LDAP.

* Add a "GitoliteEnvironment" to support the use of the script with
  Gitolite-managed repositories.  For Gitolite repositories, the name
  of the repository and the name of the user doing the push have to be
  determined from the $GL_REPO and $GL_USER variables, respectively.
  By default, post-receive-multimail.py checks for the presence of
  those two environment variables.  If they are set, it assumes a
  "gitolite" environment; otherwise it assumes a "generic"
  environment.  Alternatively, the environment can be set explicitly
  by setting a "hooks.environment" config setting (which can have the
  value "generic" or "gitolite") or by passing an --environment option
  to the script.

* Use abbreviated commit names in most places in emails.  Also add
  one-line log message summaries where possible.

* In the schematic diagrams that explain non-fast-forward commits,
  show the names of the branches involved.

* Make the email "From" address configurable.  By default, set the
  email "Reply-To" headers to reply to the pusher (for reference
  updates) and to the author (for commit notifications).

* Add a "hooks.administrator" email address to which unsubscribe
  requests can be directed.

* Written in Python.  Easier to implement nontrivial data structures
  and to add new features.

* The "hooks.showrev" configuration option is not supported.


Notes
=====

* Copyright notice: I kept the copyright notice of Andy Parkins, since
  the script is ultimately derived from his.  But I added my own
  copyright notice, since the script is mostly rewritten.


To do
=====

* More testing.

* Each commit is threaded with one of the ReferenceChanges in the push
  that first introduced the commit.  The algorithm for grouping them
  could be made cleverer:

  * Distinguish between first and subsequent parents of merge commits.

  * Recognize specific git idioms (e.g., merging and deleting a
    feature branch) and describe them in more abstract terms in the
    commit emails.

* When a reference is created, show the branch(es) from which it
  appears to sprout.

* Use textwrap to correctly wrap prose output in the notification emails.

* Perhaps handle specially the case when multiple new tags point at
  the same commit (e.g., describe them all in a single email rather
  than one email per tag).

* Perhaps add an option to send emails to an arbitrary SMTP server
  using Python's smtplib rather than by using /usr/sbin/sendmail.

* Perhaps add an example plugin for working with LDAP.

* Perhaps make the templating system more flexible and easier to
  configure.



[1] post-receive-mail sends only one email for each reference that is
    changed, no matter how many commits were added to the reference.
    It is possible to have it show patches for each commit, but since
    they are inline in a long email they are hard to read.

[2] post-receive-mail processes one reference change at a time, which
    causes it to fail to describe new commits that were included in
    multiple branches.  For example, if a single push adds the "*"
    commits in the diagram below, then post-receive-mail would never
    include the details of the two commits that are common to "master"
    and "branch" in its notifications.

        o---o---o---*---*---*    <-- master
                         \
                          *---*  <-- branch



git-multimail-v2:

* Configuration variables:

  * Rename config variables to emailhook.* rather than hooks.*.

  * Add an option to read the old configuration settings and migrate
    them to the new settings, doing consistency checks along the way.
    Optionally also delete the old settings.

  * Explain procedure in README file.

* Allow old-style announcement emails to be sent.

  * Send old-style (long) announcements to hooks.announcelist.

  * Send new-style refchange emails (as now) to hooks.refchangelist.

  * What to do for people who are subscribed to both lists?  Do we
    need a separate option for people who want refchange emails
    *except* for annotated tag change emails?  Perhaps just add a way
    to disable short annotated tag change emails entirely?

  * Perhaps support hooks.showrev in this context?

* Make it easier to skip sending refchange emails.

* Better document the variables that can be used in the templates.

* Better configurability:

  * Rename script to make it importable.

  * Make it easier to get the script functionality via an import and a
    function call.

  * Better support and document how to change template contents and
    make other configuration changes without editing the script.

* Make sure that email texts (i.e., in templates) are appropriate even
  for people who are subscribed to only some of the lists.

* Patch formatting:

  * Make sure that the script does not barf on binary files that are
    improperly marked.

  * Make sure that script does not emit enormous emails for
    apparently-text files that have extremely long lines.

  * Perhaps add a hook to allow patches to be cleaned up somehow
    before being sent.

* Write a README file:

  * Move main documentation to README file.

  * Explain how to migrate from the old script to the new one.

  * Document how to run the script both ways (as script or as Python
    import).

  * Document how to modify templates.

  * Document variables available in templates.

  * Document how to define a new Environment.

* Add an LDAP environment (?)
