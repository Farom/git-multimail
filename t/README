Aids to testing git-multimail.

create-test-repo:

    Create a test repository "test-repo.git" that can be used for
    testing git-multimail.  Most of the repository is created by
    loading the dumpfile "test-repo.dump", then a few more weird tags
    are created that point to objects other than commits.

test-emails:

    Runs create-test-repo and then simulates a bunch of pushes to the
    repository, writing to stdout the emails that would normally be
    sent for those pushes.  There's as yet no automated check of the
    output; you still have to eyeball it.
